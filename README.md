Draw blast ring diagrams. See instructions in the repository.
This program is useful for those who need to draw comparative diagrams of blast alignments of small genomes (e.g. bacterial) or regions of larger genomes or metagenomes. It works on the same principles as BRIG and CIRCOS, but is simpler to use and is Python based only.
